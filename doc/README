=========================
pwnsjp 0.8.1 (2013-06-11)
=========================

**pwnsjp** is a console-based frontend to some dictionaries published by
Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN. The following dictionaries has been tested:

 - “Słownika języka polskiego”, 3 volumes (distributed as an
   attachment to Gazety Wyborcza) [3TSJP];
 - “Multimedialny słownik PWN. Frazeologia” [MSF];
 - “Multimedialny słownik PWN. Język polski” [MSJP];
 - “Multimedialny słownik PWN. Wyrazy obce” [MSWO].

You will need the ``*.win`` file, which can be extracted:
 - either by extracting from ``setup/data1.cab`` using Unshield_;
 - or by installing the original interface on Windows/Wine.

--------

You will need:

 - a modern C99 compiler;
 - *GNU make*;
 - *GNU C* library;
 - *zlib* library;
 - *ncursesw* library (*ncurses* with Unicode support);
 - additionally, if you want to build the manual pages:
    - *xsltproc* (from *libxslt*, the XSLT C library for GNOME);
 - additionally, if you need to refresh some automatically generated files:
    - *autoconf*,
    - *perl*,
    - *gperf*,
    - *konwert* or *links* or *elinks*.

   ./configure --with-dictdir=DIRECTORY-WITH-DICTIONARY-FILES
   make

   pwnsjp --help
   pwnsjp --entry-only 'b(ne|om)'
   pwnsjp '^(nie)?kłopotliwy'

Polish diacritic characters can be displayed correctly only if locale is
configured properly. Please make sure than ``locale charmap`` gives the
expected result: ``ISO-8859-2``, ``ISO-8859-16`` or ``UTF-8``.
